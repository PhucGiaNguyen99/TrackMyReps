Technical Overview

Tech Stack
- Language: Java
- Platform: Android SDK
- Local Database: SQLite (via SQLiteOpenHelper)
- Remote Database: Firebase Firestore
- Authentication: Firebase Auth
- UI Components: RecyclerView, Material Design Buttons, TextInputLayouts, CardView

Key Components
- models/Exercise.java: Model class for exercise
- WorkoutDatabaseHelper.java: Manages local DB with CRUD + default values
- WorkoutPlanManager.java: Global state manager for workout plan
- ExerciseAdapter.java: Binds exercise list to RecyclerView
- WorkoutPlanAdapter.java: Tracks session list with completion

Data Persistence & Syncing
- SQLite stores exercises locally for fast access and offline support
- Firestore stores per-user data for backup and cross-device access
- Firestore sync happens at login:
- Download all exercises for user from Firestore
- Insert them into local SQLite (refreshing local state)
- Firestore is updated after any local update:
- Only update Firestore after a successful local SQLite insert/update/delete

Input & Error Handling
- Input fields support validation and numeric-only checks
- Toast messages guide the user for successful and failed actions
- Confirmation dialogs are used for sensitive actions like delete

Firebase Integration

Authentication
- Uses Firebase Auth for secure login
- Data is linked per user via their userId

Firestore Structure
- Path: users/{userId}/exercises/{exerciseName}
- Each user's exercises are stored as separate documents

Offline Support
- Firestore reads fallback to local cache when offline
- SQLite provides primary access when network is unavailable
- Upon next login or refresh, Firestore updates are synced

Real-Time Firestore Handling
- On Add/Edit:
   + Update SQLite immediately
   + Then update Firestore (asynchronously)
- On Delete:
   + Remove from SQLite
   + Then delete from Firestore

Future Improvements
- Allow users to name and save multiple workout plans
- Track completion history with dates and stats

- Add progress charts and analytics
- Enable dark mode and color theme options
- Add optional profile with display name and profile picture
